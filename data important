    Econometric forecasting technique

Econometric Forecasting utilizes more complex relationships between demand and influencing factors to understand the relationship between them. An equation is derived and analyzed to ensure a reliable statistical representation. Finally, the projected values of the influencing factors are derived into the equation to generate an accurate forecast.

Econometric Forecasting generally focuses on different aspects of economic interactions with each other. For example, how spendings could influence income, interest rates, debt, unemployment, etc.



    Trend projection method

This method is suitable for businesses with extensive sales data with a history of 20-24 months. The data extracted generates statistical time series representing previous sales and projected demand for a specific product category under normal conditions by plotting a graph of the given information.

The benefit of the trend projection method is that it is based on numerical data and can be altered in several different ways. The analysis is more precise, and it can be replicated or refined according to need.

The down point of trend projection is that it does not address the underlying problems that may have catalyzed the trend. For example, a natural disaster, like an earthquake or a wildfire, could present you with a slanted view. More data is required to provide accurate projections.



    Barometric technique

In this technique of Demand Forecasting, current events are recorded for the prediction of the future. In the Demand Forecasting process, this is accomplished by having a look at the economic indicators. Mainly, a demographic evaluation like the Leading series, Lagging series, or Concurrent series is arranged to generate the Demand Forecast.

The barometric forecasting technique’s upside is that it solves the issue of identifying the value of an individual variable. A significant disadvantage of this method is that we can’t use it for long-term forecasting.


Como comprobar que el sistema funcione

Realizar una analisis de datos outliers.

Centrar datos de demanda y precios con una varianza conservadora? o riesgosa?

Valor de inflacion constante a los anteriores. 

Realizar un sistema de regresion lineal basado en las series de tiempo

Target es Precio_Prom o demanda

Variables Descuento, inflacion, oferta, Popularidad del producto?, 

margen, utilidad y elasticidad creo que no deberian de agregarse -> Prediccion de ventas

Functionality

Obviously, the first thing you have to look at is whether it fits your business requirements. Depending on your industry and business model, you might need

    short-term or long-term predictions (or both);
    demand forecasting for new products;
    multitiered planning for different regions, channels, and product groups;
    price elasticity estimation;
    multidimensional modeling and comparisons of what-if scenarios (for promotions, price changes, market fluctuations, display variations, assortment changes, etc.);
    accounting for halo effects and product cannibalization (when demand fluctuations of one product impact complementary or competitive items);
    granular dashboards and reports, and so on.


Predict price elasticity and then prredict demand

Predictive BDA applicability
Most data-driven models used in the literature consider historical data. Such a back-
ward-looking forecasting ignores the new trends and highs and lows in different eco-
nomic environments. Also, organizational factors, such as reputation and marketing
strategies, as well as internal risks (related to availability of SCM resources), could
greatly influence the demand [107] and thus contribute to inaccuracy of BDA-based
demand predictions using historical data. Incorporating existing driving factors out-
side the historical data, such as economic instability, inflation, and purchasing power,
could help adjust the predictions with respect to unseen future scenarios of demand.
Combining predictive algorithms with optimization or simulation can equip the mod-
els with prescriptive capabilities in response to future scenarios and expectations.
